This is just a simple media scanner for users and developers who see empty blocks (placeholders) of deleted media files.
This app can scan the whole device (or selected paths) for media, when they don't show up in Gallery or social media apps..
You even can select more than 100k paths (unless your phone runs out of memory, and I wouldn't recommend it either)

So... there you go... use it..., stay happy and enjoy the life.
